# Home Dashboard
A dashboard with useful information to display in my house. The idea is to build a dashboard which then will be displayed 24/7 on a tablet stuck to the fridge via magnets.

Train times widget had the help from 'Dashional Rail' by [Smittey](https://github.com/Smittey/Dashional-Rail)

Originally created using the [Smashing](https://github.com/Smashing/smashing) dashboard in Ruby, but moved to a [Unity3D](https://unity.com/) project as I was after some interactivity (such as adding and removing from a TODO list) instead of just displaying information (And also I could customize the widgets further than the Smashing dashboard).
