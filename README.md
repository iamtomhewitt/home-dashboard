# Home Dashboard
A dashboard with useful information to display in my house. The idea is to build and host a dashboard which then will be displayed 24/7 on a tablet stuck to the fridge via magnets.

## Dashboard
Will be created via Smashing and will contain widgets along the following:
* Weather
* News
* Train times from Horsforth station (Thanks [Smittey](https://github.com/Smittey/Dashional-Rail)!)
* Clock
* Google Calendar integration
* Some sort of list where we can use other devices to add items (e.g. a shopping list)
