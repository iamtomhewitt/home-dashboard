# 🏡 Home Dashboard

<p align="center">
  <img src="github.png">
</p>

A dashboard with useful information to display in my house. The idea is to build a dashboard which then will be displayed 24/7 on a tablet stuck to the fridge via magnets.

Originally created using the [Smashing](https://github.com/Smashing/smashing) dashboard in Ruby, but moved to a [Unity3D](https://unity.com/) project as I was after some interactivity (such as adding and removing from a shopping list) instead of just displaying information (And also I could customize the widgets further than the Smashing dashboard).

## 🎯 Widgets
The current set of widgets on my dashboard are:

### 🕒 Clock
A clock showing the date and time.

### 📆 Google Calendars
A scrollable widget showing mine and my partners calendar for the next three months. Any edits to calendar events are done through the Google Calendar app itself and not the dashboard.

### 📝 Online Lists
Scrollable list widgets - one for TODOs, and one for the shopping list. The lists are integrated with the `Todoist` app, so I can add items to the shopping list via the app on my mobile.

### 📰 BBC News
A widget that cycles headlines every minute. New headlines are fetched over time. Tapping on the BBC news widget opens up the displayed headline on the BBC news website.

### ☀ Weather
Forecast for now, and the next four days.

### 🚂 Trains
A scrollable widget showing the latest trains from my local stations, showing any cancellations or delays.

### 🚮 Bin Day
An alert to show if the bin needs putting out. Changes colour based on which bin to put out.

### 🥘 Food Planner
An editable set of 'cards' to show what we're having for our evening meal for the week.
I've also incorporated a set of predefined recipes from what we eat often. Pressing the button at the bottom of the planner will add every single ingredient from all the predefined recipes for that week to the shopping list widget, so you can plan your weekly shop based on what you are eating. Duplicate ingredients are also removed, so if you have a recipe of 200g of chicken, and another recipe with 400g of chicken, then 600g of chicken is added to your shopping list.

## 💡 Potential Widget / General Ideas

### Rotating Widgets
As it stands the dashboard is a bit constrained for room. Suggest that any future widgets can sit over the top of another widget, and switch with another widget in its place. E.g. the Google Calendar widgets could be combined into one and switch between calendars every `x` seconds.
